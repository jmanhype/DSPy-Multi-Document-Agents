# System Architecture

The Multi-Document Agent Q&A System employs a distributed knowledge fabric that intelligently partitions textual document sources into separate semi-autonomous agents known as [Document Agents](/system-architecture/document-agents). These agents encapsulate the content and semantic essence of their designated document partitions through advanced [Vector Embeddings](/system-architecture/vector-embeddings), enabling efficient semantic searches and content retrieval.

At the core of this architecture lies the [Qdrant Vector Database](/system-architecture/qdrant-vector-database), which plays a crucial role in storing and retrieving document embeddings. This high-performance vector similarity search engine allows for rapid and accurate retrieval of relevant documents based on their semantic similarity to the input query.

The distributed nature of the system architecture ensures scalability and flexibility, allowing it to handle large volumes of documents and complex queries efficiently.

The main components of the system architecture can be visualized using the following diagram:

    D --> E[Qdrant Vector Database]
    E --> F[Query Processing]
    F --> G[Relevant Documents]
```

The flow of data in the system architecture can be summarized in the following steps:

<Steps>

### Step 1

Document sources are partitioned into separate document agents, each responsible for a specific subset of the overall knowledge base.

### Step 2

Each document agent generates vector embeddings for its assigned documents, capturing their semantic content in a dense, numerical representation.

### Step 3

The vector embeddings are stored in the Qdrant Vector Database, allowing for efficient retrieval based on semantic similarity.

### Step 4

During query processing, the relevant document agents are selected based on the query's content and historical performance data.

### Step 5

The selected document agents retrieve the most relevant documents from the Qdrant Vector Database based on the semantic similarity between the query and the document embeddings.

</Steps>

By leveraging this distributed architecture and advanced vector embedding techniques, the Multi-Document Agent Q&A System achieves high performance, scalability, and accuracy in processing complex queries and retrieving relevant information from large document collections.
