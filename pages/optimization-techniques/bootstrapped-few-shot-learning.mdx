# Bootstrapped Few-Shot Learning

The Multi-Document Agent Q&A System employs an innovative optimization technique called **Bootstrapped Few-Shot Learning** to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the reranking process. This technique is implemented using the `BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch` class from the `dspy` library.

## How it Works

Bootstrapped Few-Shot Learning is a method that allows the system to learn from a small number of examples (few-shot learning) and iteratively improve its performance by generating additional synthetic examples (bootstrapping). The process works as follows:

<Steps>

### Step 1: Initialize the Reranking Optimizer

The `RerankingOptimizer` class is initialized with the reranking module (`RerankModule`) as a parameter. This optimizer is responsible for fine-tuning the reranking process using the Bootstrapped Few-Shot Learning technique.

### Step 2: Generate Training Examples

The `trainset_generator()` function is used to generate training examples for the optimization process. Each example consists of a document ID, an initial relevance score, and a query. These examples are used to evaluate the performance of different reranking configurations.

### Step 3: Compile the Optimized Program

The `BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch` technique is applied using the `teleprompter.compile()` method. This method takes the reranking module (`self.rerank_module`) and the training examples generated by `trainset_generator()` as inputs.

```python
optimized_program = self.teleprompter.compile(
    student=self.rerank_module,
    trainset=trainset_generator()
)
```

During the compilation process, the optimizer randomly samples different configurations of the reranking module and evaluates their performance using a custom metric (Mean Squared Error). The best-performing configuration is selected as the optimized program.

### Step 4: Apply the Optimized Program

The optimized program is then used to refine the relevance scores of the retrieved documents. This ensures that the most relevant documents are ranked higher in the search results, improving the overall accuracy of the Q&A system.

<Callout type="info">
The Bootstrapped Few-Shot Learning technique enables the system to continuously learn and adapt to new queries and documents, without requiring a large amount of labeled training data. This makes it an efficient and effective approach for optimizing the reranking process in the Multi-Document Agent Q&A System.
